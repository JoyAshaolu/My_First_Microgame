<br/> In this class, I learned a lot of this that really surprised me. The things I learned were to change the colour of the floor. I learned to add a new robot/ enemy, to add a room and to import random objects. I also learned how to add a screenshot as a code and how to create a new line in GitHub. Creating a room was a simple straight forward task that was understandable, and I was able to understand and set up everything without issues.
